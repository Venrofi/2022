### What I learned

This was my very first Angular project and also using TypeScript. I got to know the syntax and structure of Angular framework, coming from React. I understand the basics, for example the process of creating components, adding routes, services. I used json-server library to emulate backend for the app. I know also how to disable certain DOM Elements for routes different than designed for.

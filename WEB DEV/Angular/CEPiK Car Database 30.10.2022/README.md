### What I learned

This was my very first time creating an Angular app with API calls done via a proxy server. I learned how to create a proxy server, how to make right API calls and how to use obtained data. I've also implemented pagination which was easier than I thought thanks to ngx-paginaton. For the proxy server I've used express, nodemon & axios packages.
